# researchp-tools

This repository hosts utilities to collaborate on [Github pages designed for research science](https://github.com/Materials-Informatics-Lab/research-pages).

Github Research pages host ``_data`` and ``_posts`` corresponding to scientifici research.  Both folders contain serialized ``YAML`` or ``JSON`` 
to write posts, share infromation, and present research findings.  The tools in this repository assist in accessing
YAML, JSON, and YAML front-matter to a local computing environment.  **Currently, this only works for Matlab.**
